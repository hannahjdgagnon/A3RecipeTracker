css is my own, other than using notes from lecture slides/canvas or googling on sites like W3Schools, Adobe, etc for help on specific things (ie; stuff like font ideas, how to get proper margin spacing, the button:hover { background-color: xxx }, padding, colour pallates, and similiar things if I had forgotten how to do them)
